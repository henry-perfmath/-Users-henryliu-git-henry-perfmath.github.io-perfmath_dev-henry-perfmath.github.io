<h1>Updated on April 28, 2014 (webflow related changes)</h1>

<p>SpringSource somehow recently removed the spring-webflow-2.4.xsd from its website and now it 
must be changed to spring-webflow.xsd. Please download the latest soba project or make the 
following changes if you have already downloaded and set up soba project on your IDE:</p>

<p>Locate the *.xml file in each of the folders in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/flow/{customerDetails, 
customerSearch, onlineService and transferMoney} and replace spring-webflow-2.4.xsd with 
spring-webflow.xsd.</p>

<p>Also, to make transferMoney webflow example work, you need to modify the ehcache.xml file in the src/main/resources 
folder so that the maxElementsInMemory="10000" for both defaultCache and aclCache. Otherwise, transferMoney will 
not succeed and you will find errors in soba.log file like "ERROR disk.DiskStorageFactory Disk Write of 
org.springframework.security.acls.domain.ObjectIdentityImpl[Type: 
com.perfmath.spring.soba.model.domain.BankingTx; Identifier: 443759348] failed: net.sf.ehcache.CacheException: 
Failed to serialize element due to ConcurrentModificationException. This is frequently the result of inappropriately 
sharing thread unsafe object (eg. ArrayList, HashMap, etc) between threads."</p>

<h1>Updated on April 21, 2014 (two jackson dependencies missing)</h1>

<p>Please make the following two changes and SOBA 4 should work in your environment:</p>

<p>1) Locate the soba-webflow.xml file in the folder src/main/webapp/WEB-INF and change 2.4.xsd to 
2.3.xsd. It's very strange that somehow recently Spring removed the 2.4.xsd file and I even couldn't 
run SOBA sample in my environment anymore. It has to be changed to 2.3. I have had 2.4 for 
SOBA3.2GA and it worked just fine.</p>

<p>2) Add the following two dependencies to the project pom.xml file, rebuild and deploy SOBA as 
described in the book.  </p>

<dependency>
<groupId>org.codehaus.jackson</groupId>
<artifactId>jackson-mapper-asl</artifactId>
<version>1.9.13</version>
</dependency>
</textarea>
<p>After you make these two changes, SOBA should run in your environment as well.</p>
